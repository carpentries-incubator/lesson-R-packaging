This repository provides a blank starting point for lessons to be developed here.

A member of the [Carpentries Curriculum Team](https://carpentries.org/team/)
will work with you to get your lesson listed on the
[Community Developed Lessons page][community-lessons]
and make sure you have everything you need to begin developing your new lesson.

## What to do next

Before you begin developing your new lesson,
here are a few things we recommend you do:

* [] Find reviewers.
* [] Decide if _Getting started_ shall precede _Accessing package_.
* [] Decide about possible side topics.

questions, concerns, or experience any difficulties along the way.
