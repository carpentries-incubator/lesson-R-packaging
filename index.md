Chances are that you **used** _R_ packages before, but did you know you can **write** your own?
Moreover, did you know that this can be a brilliant idea?
Packaging helps you creating a more robust, more reproducible, and more enjoyable scientific coding experience.
And by contributing a package, you will add to the ever growing capabilities of the R language!

This workshop will provide you with the basics for writing your own packages in R.

R packages are first and foremost a standard way of structuring your work.
You have a folder for code, a folder for tests, a folder for data, a folder for documents, and so on.
The standardization makes packages easily installable and shareable.

Even if you are not planning to publish your package, structuring your work as one is also a very good idea.
It enforces, in a relatively effortless manner, the implementation of software development best practices.
This will lead to a safer and more robust working experience, and result in more accurate and reproducible work.
