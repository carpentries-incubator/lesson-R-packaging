Chances are that you **used** _R_ packages before but, did you know you can **write** your own? Even more, did you know that this can be a brilliant idea? Packaging helps you creating a more robust, more reproducible and more enjoyable scientific coding experience. And who knows?, perhaps you'll see your package published in _CRAN_ one day!

This workshop will provide you with the basics for writing your own packages in R.

R packages are no more and no less than a standard way of structuring your work. You'll have a folder for code, a folder for tests, a folder for data, a folder for documents, and so on. The standardization makes packages easily installable and shareable.

Even if you are not planning to publish your package, structuring your research as one is also a very good idea. It enforces, in a relatively effortless manner, the implementation of software development best practices. This will lead to a safer, more robust, more manageable and more enjoyable working experience.
