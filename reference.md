## Glossary

- **Attach** a package: load the package into the workspace. This is typically done by `library(<package name>)`.
- **Dependencies**: packages often rely on other packages. The list of dependencies is the list of packages required for a package to work properly.
- **Documentation**: instructions for using your code, written in a human-readable manner.
- **Function**: a function is an object that takes a number of arguments and returns a number of outputs.
- **Install** a package: have the package available locally, but not necessarily loaded into workspace (i.e.,not necessarily _attached_). This is typically done by `install.packages(<package name>)`
- **Vignette**: a vignette is, in this context, a document that combines human-readable chunks and executable code chunks.
